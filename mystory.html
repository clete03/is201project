        <h1>My Story</h1>
        <p>I’m currently a senior at Brigham Young University majoring in Economics with a minor in Information Systems, where I’ve maintained a 3.98 GPA. I am originally from a small town in Connecticut, where I was surrounded by those who had found success in the financial industry. I initially became interested in investment banking when a senior banker spoke to a youth group, I was a part of.</p>
        
        <p>His story stuck with me as I gained operational experience during my time at DyeHard Subshots, where I designed and sold apparel, driving an increase in sales. These two experiences led me to join the Investment banking association my freshman year at BYU, which has deepened my understanding and helped me in my pursuit of a career in the industry.</p>

        <p>After my freshman year, I interned at Peak Capital Partners, where I underwrote over $1 billion worth of real estate deals, strengthening my financial modeling and analysis skills. I worked closely with the CFO, assisting in organizing financial data and streamlining past deal access. After that, I participated in a case competition with Monarch Investment, where my team took first place by conducting a full market analysis and underwriting process for an apartment complex, which we pitched to real investors.</p>

        <p>I recently returned from a two-year volunteer mission in Jamaica, where I focused heavily on increasing the effectiveness of our work. I’m passionate about financial analysis and the high-stakes, fast-paced environment of investment banking. My internship experience, combined with my strong analytical skills, leadership background, and drive, makes me eager to contribute and grow in this field.</p>
